# RNode Firmware

## Intro
This is the firmware for RNode, a very flexible LoRa-based communication device. RNode can functions as a:

- Network adapter for [RNS](https://github.com/markqvist/Reticulum)
- LoRa interface for your computer (or any device with a USB or serial port)
- Packet sniffer for LoRa networks
- LoRa development board
- A flexible platform for experiementing with LoRa technology

RNode is controlled by a powerful ATmega1284p MCU, and is fully Arduino compatible. You can use this firmware, or it can be programmed any way you like, either from the Arduino IDE, or using any of the available tools for AVR development. This firmware can also be edited and compiled directly from the Arduino IDE.

For configuring an RNode with this firmware, please have a look at the [RNode Config Utility](https://github.com/markqvist/rnodeconfigutil).

## Current Status
The RNode firmware has not seen much real world testing, and should be considered beta at this point.
